This code aims to evaluate the scalability of Zkfhed. 

In Zkfhed, when workers lack the computational capability or energy for complex data processing tasks, they can delegate the ZKPs computations to a group of evaluators through the HEDL mechanism. We designed a series of comparative experiments to measure the running time, online time, and communication overhead during the delegation process.
